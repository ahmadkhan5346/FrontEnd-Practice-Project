        By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
        Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date
        to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals,
        construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites
        in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first
        urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86]
        Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of
        subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]

        During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to
        the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this
        period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper
        Gangetic Plain.[87]
